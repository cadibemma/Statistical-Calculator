***Z score***

Simply put, a z-score (also called a standard score) gives you an idea of how far from the mean a data point is. 
But more technically it’s a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is.
A z-score can be placed on a normal distribution curve. Z-scores range from -3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far left of the normal distribution curve) up to +3 standard deviations
The Z Score Formula: One Sample
The basic z score formula for a sample is: <br>

z = (x – μ) / σ

For example, let’s say you have a test score of 190. The test has a mean (μ) of 150 and a standard deviation (σ) of 25. Assuming a normal distribution, your z score would be: <br>

z = (x – μ) / σ
= (190 – 150) / 25 = 1.6.

The z score tells you how many standard deviations from the mean your score is. In this example, your score is 1.6 standard deviations above the mean.

alternate-z-scoreYou may also see the z score formula shown to the left. This is exactly the same formula as z = x – μ / σ, except that x̄ (the sample mean) is used instead of μ (the population mean) and s (the sample standard deviation) is used instead of σ (the population standard deviation). However, the steps for solving it are exactly the same.

Z Score Formula: Standard Error of the Mean
When you have multiple samples and want to describe the standard deviation of those sample means (the standard error), you would use this z score formula<br> 
z = (x – μ) / (σ / √n)
This z-score will tell you how many standard errors there are between the sample mean and the population mean.

Example question: You take the SAT and score 1100. The mean score for the SAT is 1026 and the standard deviation is 209. How well did you score on the test compared to the average test taker?

Step 1: Write your X-value into the z-score equation. For this example question the X-value is your SAT score, 1100.

Step 2: Put the mean, μ, into the z-score equation.

Step 3: Write the standard deviation, σ into the z-score equation.

Step 4: Find the answer using a calculator:
(1100 – 1026) / 209 = .354. This means that your score was .354 std devs above the mean.

Step 5: (Optional) Look up your z-value in the z-table to see what percentage of test-takers scored below you. A z-score of .354 is .1368 + .5000* = .6368 or 63.68%.

*Why add .500 to the result? The z-table shown has scores for the RIGHT of the mean. Therefore, we have to add .500 for all of the area LEFT of the mean. For more examples of when to add (or subtract) .500, see several examples in: Area under a normal distribution curve.
