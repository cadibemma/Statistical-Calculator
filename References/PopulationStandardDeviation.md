 **Population Standard Deviation**
 
The population standard deviation is a measure of the spread (variability) of the scores on a given variable and is represented by:
σ = sqrt[ Σ ( Xi – μ )2 / N ]
The symbol ‘σ’ represents the population standard deviation.  The term ‘sqrt’ used in this statistical formula denotes square root.  The term ‘Σ ( Xi – μ )2’ used in the statistical formula represents the sum of the squared deviations of the scores from their population mean.<br>
