# Project Outline 



## Abstract
The project  goal is to create a statistical calculator with the ability to to do statistical functions and ability to read datafiles/CSV files.

### Phase 1
Set up our project skeleton  with Dockerfile, integrate with Travis for testing and create central repository through Git.

### Phase 2 

#### Developmental Task 1
***New feature***  We Create a basic Calculator that does  basic operations. 
Create a Calculator folder that has a calculator module  to the Calculator folder and add basic operations as static methods each with its own file.

***Description***

Addition :The addition is taking two or more numbers and adding them together, that is, it is the total sum of 2 or more numbers. A + B : 2 + 2 = 4 Sum 

subtraction : Is taking one number away from another that is the difference. A - B  : 2 - 1 = 1 Difference

Multiplication :  IS an increase in the number or amount of something. A * B  : 2 * 2 = 4 Product

Division : Is splitting into equal parts or groups. A / B : 4 / 2 = 2 

Square : is an arithmetic operator that signifies multiplying a number by itself. A * A : 2 * 2 = 4

Square root : The square root is just the opposite of the square. √A  : √ 4 = 2



#### Developmental Task 2
***New feature*** Ability to pass Data to our Calculator module

***Description***

Create a CSV reader folder  with the ability to read  data files.



#### Developmental Task 3
***Performance improvement***Create a Test folder  unit testing each of the basic operations

***Description***
If all the Tests are passed then we move on to the next Phase 



### Phase 3

#### Developmental Task 4

New Feature : Add functionality to the calculator that will enable application to do  statistical functions.
We will extend the basic operations that allow us to do statistical operations to the statistical module.
