Sample Standard Deviation

The statistic called sample standard deviation, is a measure of the spread (variability) of the scores in the sample on a given variable and is represented by:
s = sqrt [ Σ ( xi – x_bar )2 / ( n – 1 ) ]
The term ‘Σ ( xi – x_bar )2’ represents the sum of the squared deviations of the scores from the sample mean.
